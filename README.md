MAJOR COMPONENTS OF HADOOP 2.X ARE:
1.Yarn
2.HDFS
3.Mapreduce

Yarn(Yet Another Resource Negotiator): Hadoop 2.x Architecture has one extra and new component that is : YARN. It is really game changing component in BigData Hadoop System. It is new Component in Hadoop 2.x Architecture. It is also know as “MR V2”.
Hadoop 2.x YARN has the following benefits.

Highly Scalability
Highly Availability
Supports Multiple Programming Models
Supports Multi-Tenancy
Supports Multiple Namespaces
Improved Cluster Utilization
Supports Horizontal Scalability

HDFS: HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is also know as HDFS V2 as it is part of Hadoop 2.x with some enhanced features. It is used as a Distributed Storage System in Hadoop Architecture.
