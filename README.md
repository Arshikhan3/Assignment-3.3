MAJOR COMPONENTS OF HADOOP 2.X ARE:
1.Yarn
2.HDFS
3.Mapreduce

Yarn(Yet Another Resource Negotiator): Hadoop 2.x Architecture has one extra and new component that is : YARN. It is really game changing component in BigData Hadoop System. It is new Component in Hadoop 2.x Architecture. It is also know as “MR V2”.

Hadoop 2.x YARN has the following benefits.

1.Highly Scalability
2.Highly Availability :
• There is a pair of NameNodes in an active-standby configuration
• In the event of failure of an active NameNode, the standby takes over its duties without a
significant interruption.

3.Supports Multiple Programming Models
4.Supports Multi-Tenancy
5.Supports Multiple Namespaces
6.Improved Cluster Utilization
7.Supports Horizontal Scalability

HDFS: HDFS stands for Hadoop Distributed File System. It is also know as HDFS V2 as it is part of Hadoop 2.x with some enhanced features. It is used as a Distributed Storage System in Hadoop Architecture.

Mapreduce: MapReduce is a Batch Processing or Distributed Data Processing Module. It is also know as “MR V1” as it is part of Hadoop 1.x with some updated features.
